other issues
------------
- when you reload in IE, outline view shows the main page content

- local types can be only referenced from the same cu.
- "usage search" index is often broken if source files fail to analyze

- consider eliminating usage table for Object, String, and a few other very common types.
  index often just gets too large.
- labels and break/continue
- balanced parenthesis
- block folding
- when jumping to definition, move to the center screen
- better handling for jumping to external source files
  (including JRE)
- search for usage
- current line number layout method doesn't work in Opera.
  define another class that does dumb-but-easy approach
