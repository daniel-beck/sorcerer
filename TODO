other issues
------------
- enum const declaration doesn't have <a name="">
- labels and break/continue
- balanced parenthesis
- block folding
- when jumping to definition, move to the center screen
- better handling for jumping to external source files
  (including JRE)
- permalink at the point of definition
- search for usage
- current line number layout method doesn't work in Opera.
  define another class that does dumb-but-easy approach
- b86 didn't work as some classes were renaemd
- b99-test didn't work for some reasons.

- using frame for toolbar didn't work very well.
  when I move border in IE, it just expands toolbar.

- layout-wise, doubly nested frameset works OK on both FF and IE.
  cross-domain will become an issue, though.
