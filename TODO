other issues
------------
- #this shouldn't be used like "#this-fieldName".
- when you reload in IE, outline view shows the main page content

- local types can be only referenced from the same cu.
- "usage search" index is often broken if source files fail to analyze

- consider eliminating usage table for Object, String, and a few other very common types.
  index often just gets too large.
- labels and break/continue
- balanced parenthesis
- block folding
- when jumping to definition, move to the center screen
- better handling for jumping to external source files
  (including JRE)
- search for usage
  - support for searching declarations that are confied within a single compilation unit,
    such as local variables. They don't produce usage index, so we need a different scheme.
  - usage of private methods are always confined within a single CU.
    think about those cases and reduce the size of the usage index.
  - highlight the usage in the source view
- current line number layout method doesn't work in Opera.
  define another class that does dumb-but-easy approach


HTML in JS
----------
Pros:
  - cross domain reference and linking

Cons:
  - opening a particular class from file explorer is no longer very easy


Format:

 [ token stream ... ]

   string means literal to be printed.
   object means an intelligent marker.
   certain markers can yield text (like reserved word markers.)
   markers can have nested token stream to organize information in a hierarchy.

Experiments:

  - it's really crucial that we can override the prototype of those objects to make them intelligent.
    -> Nope. But write 'new Foo(...)' to create a specific object type.
  - check that '#anchor' navigation can be still made to work.
